# Buildkite Frontend

This repository contains the UI components that make up the Buildkite frontend.
The main technologies used are:

- ES6
- Webpack
- Relay
- React
- GraphQL
- Basscss

It doesn't contain all of Buildkite's frontend currently, but we'll be adding
to this repository more and more as we migrate stuff from our old frontend
system to our new one.
