## Install the Agent on your own AWS instance

To run the agent on your own AWS instances use whichever installer matches your instance type. For Amazon Linux use the RH/CentOS installer.

## Use our pre-built Elastic CI Stack for AWS

The [Elastic CI Stack for AWS](https://github.com/buildkite/elastic-ci-stack-for-aws) is a preâ€“built CloudFormation template that gives you an autoscaling agent cluster including Docker, S3 and CloudWatch integration. [Read the documentation](https://github.com/buildkite/elastic-ci-stack-for-aws) on GitHub, and launch it using the details below:

<a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home#/stacks/new?stackName=buildkite&templateURL=https://s3.amazonaws.com/buildkite-aws-stack/aws-stack.json" target="_blank">{{<img src={awsLaunchStackButtonImage} alt="Launch Buildkite Elastic CI Stack" width="144" height="27"/>}}</a>

You will need your <strong>BuildkiteAgentToken</strong> when launching the stack:

```
{{props.token || 'INSERT-YOUR-AGENT-TOKEN-HERE'}}
```

<p class="rounded bg-silver p2">We recommend following AWS best practice by setting up a separate development AWS account and using role switching and consolidated billing. See the AWS tutorial on <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/tutorial_cross-account-with-roles.html">access delegation across AWS accounts</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/buildkite/elastic-ci-stack-for-aws">Elastic CI Stack repository on GitHub</a> for full documentation.</p>
